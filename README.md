## System Flow/Architechture 

The system is designed to process and respond to user queries by:
1. Extracting Information: The system can extract text from uploaded PDF documents.
2. Text Chunking: The extracted text is divided into smaller, manageable chunks.
3. Embedding Creation: Each chunk of text is converted into vector embeddings using OpenAIâ€™s language models, which are representations that the AI can understand and work with.
4. Storing Data: The vector embeddings are stored in Pinecone, a vector database designed for similarity searches.
5. User Interaction: Users interact with the system through a Streamlit interface, where they can ask questions and receive answers. The system searches for relevant information using the embeddings and generates responses with the help of OpenAIâ€™s language model.
6. History and Storage: All interactions (questions and responses) are stored in Firebase, which allows the system to maintain context and recall past conversations.
